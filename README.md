Concept
----------
Nearby Shops is a Hyperlocal Shopping platform where a customer can buy directly from the shops available in his/her local area and get their orders delivered to their home or just pick the order up from the shop. 

In the new emerging world, customers are getting tired of going outside the home to shop every day. They would much prefer to simply place an order and have the products delivered to their home the same day. 

Conventional e-commerce has issues ... the delivery takes a long time and it's more difficult to trust unknown vendors whom you cannot see and meet. Hyperlocal e-commerce solves these issues because delivery is faster and customers can reach out to the vendors easily. 

Nearby Shops can also be used as a food Delivery platform where restaurants can use it to deliver food. 

Nearby Shops implements Alibaba's New Offline-to-Online Concept, where customers discover products online and then pick those products up from physical stores.

Tech Stack and app Architecture
--------------------------------

Uses Android Jetpack and Googleâ€™s Recommended Architecture Patterns - Migration to MVVM is planned

Written in both Java and Kotlin : Migration to kotlin is planned and will be coming in near future

Built using Butterknife, Retrofit, Ok-HTTP, Picasso, Dagger, and the Mapbox Android SDK

User-Interface is made using the modular View-Holder Pattern which makes the UI blocks modular, easy to reuse, modify and understand.

The app uses Single Activity Architecture, where most of the screens are implemented as fragments and there are only 2-3 activities in the entire project.
